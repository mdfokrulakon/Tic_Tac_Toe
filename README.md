Tic Tac Toe: Smart Play Edition

This is a console-based Tic Tac Toe game written in C++, designed for both Player vs Player and Player vs Computer gameplay. The computer opponent uses the Minimax algorithm, ensuring intelligent and unbeatable moves.
Players can choose their marker (X or O), and the game keeps track of wins, losses, and draws through a scoreboard.

The interface is simple and user-friendly, running entirely in the terminal. After each round, users can choose to play again or exit. This project is ideal for demonstrating knowledge of arrays, loops, conditionals, functions, and basic AI.

How to Run:

1. Save as `tic_tac_toe.cpp`
2. Compile: `g++ tic_tac_toe.cpp -o tic_tac_toe`
3. Run: `./tic_tac_toe`

Requirements:

* C++ Compiler (e.g., g++)
